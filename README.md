# Documents parser

### Description

> This is a document parser that does not rely on any third-party libraries. It automatically parses column names and creates fields in the database based on them. The parser requires you to specify the names of single column headers, such as "company". To run the parser, simply execute the "main.py" file.
> The total calculated during code execution will be returned to the terminal upon completion.

### Run

In the terminal, use the run command:

```sh
main.py
```
